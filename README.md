# Cryptography Project

This repository contains the **frontend** implementation of a cryptography project built using React. It provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using classical encryption techniques.

## Features

- Classical encryption algorithms such as Caesar Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, and others.
- User-friendly interface for inputting and visualizing encryption/decryption.
- Interactive functionality with real-time updates.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
